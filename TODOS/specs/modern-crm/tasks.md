- [ ] 24.6 **Amélioration Merge - Gestion noms différents** 🔄 **NOUVEAU**

  **Problématique:** Actuellement, le merge Digiforma → CRM se base principalement sur l'**email** des contacts. Si une institution a un nom légèrement différent entre Digiforma et le CRM (ex: "CHU de Lyon" vs "CHU Lyon"), le système peut ne pas détecter le match.

  **Stratégies de matching à implémenter:**

  - [ ] **24.6.1 Backend - Algorithmes de matching avancés**

    **Fuzzy matching sur noms d'institutions:**

    - [ ] Intégrer une librairie de fuzzy string matching (ex: `fuzzball`, `string-similarity`)
    - [ ] Calculer un score de similarité entre noms (Levenshtein, Jaro-Winkler)
    - [ ] Définir un seuil de matching (ex: 85% de similarité)
    - [ ] Combiner plusieurs critères : nom + ville + code postal
    - [ ] Créer un service `DigiformaMatchingService` dédié

    **Normalisation des noms:**

    - [ ] Supprimer les accents, ponctuation, majuscules
    - [ ] Retirer les mots communs ("Clinique", "Centre", "Hôpital", etc.)
    - [ ] Normaliser les abréviations (CHU, CH, Ste → Sainte)

    **Matching multi-critères:**

    - [ ] Email contact (priorité 1, score 100%)
    - [ ] Nom + Ville (priorité 2, score fuzzy)
    - [ ] Nom + Code postal (priorité 3, score fuzzy)
    - [ ] SIRET si disponible (priorité 4, score 100%)

    **Fichiers à créer/modifier:**

    - `packages/backend/src/services/DigiformaMatchingService.ts`
    - Modifier `packages/backend/src/services/DigiformaSyncService.ts`

  - [ ] **24.6.2 Backend - Table de mapping manuel**

    **Nouveau modèle `DigiformaInstitutionMapping`:**

    ```typescript
    {
      digiformaCompanyId: string // ID Digiforma
      institutionId: string // ID CRM
      matchType: "auto" | "manual" | "fuzzy"
      matchScore: number // Score de confiance (0-100)
      confirmedBy: string // User ID qui a validé
      confirmedAt: Date
      notes: string // Notes de l'admin
    }
    ```

    **API endpoints:**

    - `GET /api/digiforma/unmatched-companies` : Liste des companies sans match
    - `POST /api/digiforma/mappings` : Créer un mapping manuel
    - `DELETE /api/digiforma/mappings/:id` : Supprimer un mapping
    - `GET /api/digiforma/suggested-matches/:companyId` : Suggestions de match

    **Fichiers:**

    - `packages/backend/src/models/DigiformaInstitutionMapping.ts`
    - Modifier `packages/backend/src/controllers/DigiformaController.ts`

  - [ ] **24.6.3 Frontend - Interface de réconciliation manuelle**

    **Page dédiée `/settings/digiforma/mappings`:**

    - ✅ Liste des companies Digiforma non fusionnées
    - ✅ Pour chaque company : suggestions de matches CRM avec score
    - ✅ Possibilité de valider un match suggéré
    - ✅ Possibilité de rechercher manuellement une institution
    - ✅ Bouton "Créer nouvelle institution" si aucun match
    - ✅ Historique des mappings manuels avec audit trail

    **Composants:**

    - `DigiformaMappingView.vue` : Page principale
    - `UnmatchedCompaniesList.vue` : Liste des non-fusionnés
    - `InstitutionMatchSuggestions.vue` : Suggestions avec scores
    - `ManualMappingDialog.vue` : Dialog de création mapping manuel

  - [ ] **24.6.4 Processus de synchronisation amélioré**

    **Workflow de sync avec matching intelligent:**

    1. Récupérer les companies Digiforma
    2. Pour chaque company :
       - Vérifier mapping manuel existant → utiliser si trouvé
       - Sinon : matching automatique par email → score 100%
       - Sinon : fuzzy matching sur nom + ville → score calculé
       - Si score > 85% : auto-match avec flag `matchType: 'fuzzy'`
       - Si score < 85% : marquer comme `unmatchedCompany`
    3. Notifier admin si nouvelles companies non matchées
    4. Permettre validation manuelle des fuzzy matches

  **Priorité:** 🟡 Moyenne (amélioration UX et qualité des données)
  **Dépendances:** Tâche 24 doit être complète ✅

  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.5, 5.1, 6.3_

    _Requirements: 1.2, 6.4, 6.5_

  - [ ] **24.7.2 Gestion des conflits et synchronisation bidirectionnelle**

    **Stratégie de résolution de conflits:**

    - **Timestamp-based:** Dernière modification gagne (field `updatedAt`)
    - **Source priority:** CRM ou Digiforma prioritaire selon configuration
    - **Manual resolution:** Interface pour résoudre conflits manuellement si détectés

    **Détection de boucles:**

    - Flag `syncSource: 'crm' | 'digiforma'` sur ContactPerson
    - Ne pas re-synchroniser vers la source d'origine
    - Timestamp de dernière sync pour éviter doublons

    **Queue de synchronisation:**

    - Implémenter queue (Bull/BullMQ) pour mutations asynchrones
    - Retry automatique en cas d'échec
    - Dashboard de monitoring des mutations en attente/échec

    _Requirements: 6.4, 11.1_

    - Logs de synchronisation accessibles depuis l'UI

    **Fichiers:**

    - Modifier `packages/frontend/src/components/institutions/ContactsTab.vue`
    - Créer `packages/frontend/src/components/digiforma/SyncStatusBadge.vue`

    _Requirements: 6.3, 10.1_

  - **Performance:** Mutations asynchrones pour ne pas bloquer l'UI
  - **Fiabilité:** Queue avec retry pour garantir la cohérence
  - **Audit:** Logger toutes les mutations pour traçabilité
  - **Sécurité:** Valider les droits utilisateur avant mutation Digiforma
  - **Conformité:** Respecter les contraintes Qualiopi (si applicables aux mutations)

  **Phases d'implémentation:**

  1. **Phase 1** : Mutations create/update uniquement (2-3 jours)
  2. **Phase 2** : Gestion conflits et queue asynchrone (2-3 jours)
  3. **Phase 3** : Interface monitoring et résolution manuelle (1-2 jours)

  **Priorité:** 🟢 Moyenne-Haute (amélioration workflow utilisateur)
  **Dépendances:** Tâche 24 complète ✅
  **Estimation:** 5-8 jours de développement

  _Requirements: 1.2, 6.4, 6.5, 10.1, 11.1_

  - Synchronisation : Job hebdomadaire (cron) + manuel
  - Merge strategy : Email prioritaire, fallback nom + adresse
  - Conformité : Read-only strict (Qualiopi)

## Issues Récurrents à Résoudre

### ✅ JSONB Compatibility Issues - **PROBLÈME RÉSOLU** (2025-11-02)

**Solution implémentée avec approche hybride:**

- ✅ **Approche relationnelle** : Modèle `InstitutionAddress` créé avec table dédiée
- ✅ **Approche hybride intelligente** : MedicalInstitution peut utiliser soit relationnel (`addressRel`) soit JSONB (`address`)
- ✅ **Tests complets** : Les deux modes sont testés avec `USE_RELATIONAL_ADDRESSES=true/false`
- ✅ **Fallback intelligent** : Le code préfère relationnel, fallback sur JSONB si nécessaire
- ✅ **Performance optimisée** : Index PostgreSQL sur champs d'adresse relationnels
- ✅ **Compatibilité maintenue** : Structure JSONB préservée pour backward compatibility

**Architecture de la solution:**

```typescript
// Approche relationnelle (recommandée)
const institutions = await MedicalInstitution.findAll({
  include: [{
    model: InstitutionAddress,
    as: 'addressRel',
    required: true // INNER JOIN pour performance
  }]
})

// Fallback JSONB (si pas de relationnel)
const institution = medicalInstitution.getFullAddress() // addrRel || address JSONB
```

**Tests de validation:**

- ✅ Test unitaire `medical-institution-address-relational.test.ts` couvre les 2 modes
- ✅ Mode relationnel avec `USE_RELATIONAL_ADDRESSES=true`
- ✅ Mode JSONB avec `USE_RELATIONAL_ADDRESSES=false` (fallback)

**Migration recommandée pour production:**
- Les nouvelles institutions utiliseront la structure relationnelle
- Les institutions existantes conservent leur structure JSONB
- Migration automatique progressive possible via script de conversion

**Impact:**
- ✅ Requêtes Sequelize avec includes fonctionnent sans erreur
- ✅ Performance améliorée avec relations indexées
- ✅ Structure de données plus robuste et normalisée
- ✅ Plus d'erreurs de sérialisation/désérialisation

**ÉTAT:** ✅ **RÉSOLU DÉFINITIVEMENT** - Le système peut désormais utiliser l'une ou l'autre approche selon les besoins.

## 🚀 28. Améliorations système de relances (Optimisations futures)

### Contexte

Le système de relances est fonctionnel (9/10) mais peut être amélioré pour scalabilité et observabilité.

### 28.1 Persistence du cache anti-spam (Priorité MOYENNE)

**Problème actuel:**

- Cache en mémoire (`Map<string, Date>`) perdu au restart serveur
- Notifications re-envoyées immédiatement après redémarrage
- Pas d'historique des notifications envoyées

**Solution: Table `reminder_notification_logs`**

**Actions:**

- [ ] Créer migration `reminder_notification_logs` table
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE reminder_notification_logs (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    rule_id UUID REFERENCES reminder_rules(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    entity_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    entity_id UUID NOT NULL,
    sent_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    recipient_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    notification_type VARCHAR(100),
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'sent', -- sent/failed
    error_message TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
  );
  CREATE INDEX idx_reminder_logs_rule ON reminder_notification_logs(rule_id);
  CREATE INDEX idx_reminder_logs_entity ON reminder_notification_logs(entity_type, entity_id);
  CREATE INDEX idx_reminder_logs_sent_at ON reminder_notification_logs(sent_at);
  ```
- [ ] Créer modèle `ReminderNotificationLog.ts`
- [ ] Modifier `ReminderService.shouldSendNotification()` pour vérifier DB
- [ ] Modifier `ReminderService.markNotificationSent()` pour écrire en DB
- [ ] Ajouter cleanup automatique (>30 jours) dans job cron
- [ ] Migration de données (optionnel)

**Bénéfices:**

- ✅ Cache persistant (survit au restart)
- ✅ Historique complet pour debugging
- ✅ Analytics possibles (taux d'envoi, échecs)
- ✅ Audit trail

**Estimation:** 3-4h

### 28.2 Limite de traitement configurable (Priorité BASSE)

**Problème actuel:**

- Limite hardcodée à 100 entités par type (tasks/quotes/invoices)
- Si >100 tâches due le même jour, certaines ignorées
- Peu probable mais possible en production

**Solution: Configuration + boucle**

**Actions:**

- [ ] Ajouter variable env `REMINDER_BATCH_SIZE` (défaut 100)
- [ ] Modifier `getTasksForReminder()` pour accepter offset/limit
- [ ] Modifier `getQuotesForReminder()` pour accepter offset/limit
- [ ] Modifier `getInvoicesForReminder()` pour accepter offset/limit
- [ ] Ajouter boucle dans `processAllReminders()` pour traiter par batch
- [ ] Ajouter logging du nombre total traité vs ignoré
- [ ] Documenter dans `.env.example`

**Exemple code:**

```typescript
const BATCH_SIZE = parseInt(process.env.REMINDER_BATCH_SIZE || "100")

async getTasksForReminder(rule: ReminderRule, offset = 0): Promise<ReminderData[]> {
  // ... existing logic
  const tasks = await Task.findAll({
    where: whereClause,
    offset,
    limit: BATCH_SIZE,
  })
}

async processReminderRule(rule: ReminderRule): Promise<void> {
  let offset = 0
  let hasMore = true

  while (hasMore) {
    const entities = await this.getEntitiesForRule(rule, offset)
    if (entities.length === 0) break

    for (const entity of entities) {
      await this.processEntity(rule, entity)
    }

    offset += BATCH_SIZE
    hasMore = entities.length === BATCH_SIZE
  }
}
```

**Bénéfices:**

- ✅ Traitement complet même avec >100 entités
- ✅ Configurable selon charge serveur
- ✅ Logging précis du volume traité

**Estimation:** 1-2h

### 28.3 Templates par défaut via migration (Priorité MOYENNE)

**Problème actuel:**

- Templates créés uniquement via seeder (développement)
- Si admin supprime règle par défaut, perdue
- Pas de restauration automatique

**Solution: Migration idempotente**

**Actions:**

- [ ] Créer migration `20251031000000-insert-default-reminder-rules.cjs`
- [ ] Logique idempotente (vérifier existence avant insert)
- [ ] Templates par défaut pour:
  - Tasks due soon (7j avant)
  - Tasks overdue
  - Quotes expiring soon (7j avant)
  - Invoices unpaid (30j après)
- [ ] Documenter que ces règles sont "système" (flag `is_system`?)
- [ ] Optionnel: Empêcher suppression des règles système

**Exemple migration:**

```javascript
module.exports = {
  up: async (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
    const defaultRules = [
      {
        id: '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001',
        entity_type: 'task',
        trigger_type: 'due_soon',
        // ... autres champs
      },
      // ...
    ]

    for (const rule of defaultRules) {
      const exists = await queryInterface.rawSelect('reminder_rules', {
        where: { id: rule.id }
      }, ['id'])

      if (!exists) {
        await queryInterface.bulkInsert('reminder_rules', [rule])
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Bénéfices:**

- ✅ Templates disponibles en production
- ✅ Restauration automatique si supprimés
- ✅ Cohérence entre environnements

**Estimation:** 1-2h

### 28.4 Dashboard monitoring et analytics (Priorité BASSE)

**Objectif:** Visibilité sur l'activité du système de relances

**Actions:**

- [ ] Endpoint `GET /api/reminder-rules/stats`
  - Total règles (actives/inactives)
  - Notifications envoyées (aujourd'hui/semaine/mois)
  - Top règles par volume
  - Taux d'échec
  - Dernière exécution job cron
- [ ] Endpoint `GET /api/reminder-rules/:id/logs`

  - Pagination
- [ ] Frontend: Widget dashboard
  - Card "Rappels automatiques"
  - Graphique évolution notifications
  - Liste dernières notifications
  - Actions rapides (activer/désactiver règles)
- [ ] Métriques Prometheus (optionnel)
  - `reminders_sent_total`
  - `reminders_failed_total`
  - `reminder_processing_duration_seconds`

**Exemple réponse API:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "summary": {
      "totalRules": 12,
      "activeRules": 10,

    - ✅ Remplacé `v-select` par `v-autocomplete` dans :
      - ✅ `TaskForm.vue` (création/édition de tâches)
      - ✅ `QuoteBuilder.vue` (création/édition de devis)
      - ✅ `InvoiceForm.vue` (création/édition de factures)
    - ✅ Debounce 300ms implémenté dans tous les formulaires
    - ✅ Loading state avec spinner pendant recherche
    - ✅ Minimum 2 caractères pour déclencher la recherche
    - ✅ Mode `no-filter` pour utiliser exclusivement le backend
    - _Requirements: 9.1, 12.1, 12.2_

  - [ ] **26.1.3 UX optimisée** (Améliorations futures)

    - Pré-charger les 10 institutions les plus récentes/utilisées au focus
    - Mettre en cache les résultats de recherche (LRU cache)
    - Afficher avatar/logo de l'institution si disponible
    - Tri intelligent : récents > fréquents > alphabétique
    - Shortcut clavier pour création rapide d'institution depuis l'autocomplete
