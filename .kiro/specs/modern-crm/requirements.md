# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a modern Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system built as a monorepo application, specifically designed for managing business relationships with medical institutions such as hospitals and clinics. The system will provide comprehensive contact management, billing capabilities, real-time notifications, webhook functionality, and extensible plugin architecture to integrate with external systems like Learning Management Systems (LMS) and accounting software such as SAGE.

The CRM will be built using Vue.js with PrimeVue for the frontend, Koa.js for the backend API, PostgreSQL for data persistence, and Socket.io for real-time communication. The system will include medical-specific features for segmentation and data management tailored to healthcare business contexts.
